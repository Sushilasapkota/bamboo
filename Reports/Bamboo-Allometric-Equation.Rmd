abstract:
  Bamboo belongs to the Poaceae (Gramineae) family of grasses and is well known for its ecological services as well as engineering services. Quanntifying the dimensions of the bamboo shoot is crucial for further valuation of each of the service it provides. It is difficult to measure, especially the length of the bamboo, as length is a complex dimension of the bamboo plant. There were no prior research records depicting the correlation of diameter and height variables in Nepal.The research provides the measurment of the height (length) of the bamboo for its quantification in terms of biomass as well as its carbon content. We examined the relationship between the diameter and length of the Bambusa group and the Dendrocalamus group found in Nepal. Field data was taken from 650 sample plots (circular plots with a 56.42m radius) established by the Forest Research and Training Center (FRTC), covering 66 districts of Nepal. 
  
  A multiple linear regression model was developed where 80% of the data was considered as training data and the rest as testing data. The length served as an independent variable, whereas diameter at breast height (dbh), base, and height up to culmination were used as independent variables. We used the Shapiro Wilk test to check the normality of the dataset, and the classical Levene’s test to test the variance of the data sets used for predictions. The regression coefficients were tested using a Welch’s two-sample t-test. From the results, the best fitting equation for the Bambusa group was 0.907 * ht_culmination + 0.248 * dbh + 0.8078 * base + 0.141, and for the Dendrocalamus group was 0.978 * ht_culmination + (-0.025) * dbh + 0.505 * base + 1.745. The best results were obtained when all three variables were used as independent, i.e., dbh, base, and height of culmination. The study opens up the space for further research focused on volume calculation of culms, biomass estimation, etc.

# Introduction:

Bamboo belongs to the Poaceae (Gramineae) family of grasses (Tamang et al., 2013) and is well known for providing ecological services, such as erosion control, riverbank protection, landslide prevention, land rehabilitation, soil moisture retention, biodiversity preservation, and carbon sequestration (Bhattacharya et al., 2009). Due to its economic value and varied applications in human living, it is referred to as "green gold"  (Yeasmin et al., 2015). As the plant with the quickest rate of growth on earth, with a growth range of 30-100cm per day in a growing season (Zakikhani et al., 2017), it is commonly classified as a woody plant because of its woody vascular bundle structure. In general, they grow in a wide range of climates, from tropical to temperate regions (Li & Kobayashi 2004, Meena et al. 2019). There exist approximately 1,250 distinct species distributed across 75 genera within the global bamboo taxonomic classification (Tamang et al., 2013). It is ubiquitously dispersed within tropical and subtropical regions spanning approximately 46°N to 47°S, encompassing a collective expanse of approximately 31.5 million hectares (FAO, 2005). This constituted approximately 0.8% of the global forested area as of the year 2010 (Song et al., 2011). The predominant distribution of bamboo occurs in Asia, specifically within tropical and subtropical regions, with significant concentrations in China (626 species), India (102 species), Japan (84 species), Myanmar (75 species), and Malaysia (50 species), where the cumulative bamboo-covered area in these regions is estimated to exceed 1.8×10^7 hectares, as reported by Shanmughavel and Francis (1996), Singh and Singh (1999), Embaye et al. (2003), Gratani et al. (2008), and Yen et al. (2010). In contrast, Africa displays the lowest bamboo species richness, totaling only five species (Das et al., 2005). However, Nepal on the other hand, records a total of 13 bamboo species (Bista et al., 2022).

Statistical analysis involving regression, as explained by Belsley et al. (2005), is employed to scrutinize the association between a dependent variable (referred to as the result or response variable) and one or more independent variables (termed predictors or explanatory variables). The development of reliable tools supporting informed decision-making in sustainable forestry necessitates accurate predictions of both existing resource levels and anticipated resource changes resulting from the implementation of specific management alternatives, as highlighted by Tenzin and Hasenauer (2017). The application of regression models facilitates the identification of trends and patterns, prediction of future occurrences, and exploration of the impact of one or more independent variables on the dependent variable. To achieve precise estimations of forest biomass and carbon storage at both regional and global scales, a comprehensive comprehension of the Height-Diameter (H-D) relationship is imperative. This is particularly significant given that numerous large-scale studies rely on allometric equations that integrate the Height-Diameter relationship (Feldpausch et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2016).

Although bamboo has many advantages and there is increasing demand for its products in the country, there is little published information on bamboo that demonstrates the relationship between its morphological characteristics (Oli, 2005; Bista et al., 2022). Thus, the models developed from the research will be important operational tools for supporting decision-making for a wide range of activities in the studied area. They have the capacity to depict the transient growth of trees (diameter, height, and volume), provide intricate insights into the evolution of stand structure (diameter and height distribution), compute projections for biomass and carbon stock, and facilitate the inspection of a multitude of silvicultural interventions and directives, among other functionalities (Briseno et al., 2020). Thus, this study will be a pioneering work for new researchers to develop the appropriate growth model for diverse valuable species. The model employed in this study presupposes a linear association between the dependent variable and the independent variables, representing a specific category within the realm of regression models.


# Methodology:

## Study Area

 For the study, the bamboo potential area found in the non-forest area of Nepal has been chosen. The seven bamboo species of Nepal majorly include the two genera, i.e., Bambusa and Dendrocalamus. A total of 66 districts of Nepal from east to west (28.3949 ◦ N, 84.124 ◦ E) were included in the study area, chosen and finalized by Forest Research and Training Center (FRTC).

```

## Sampling Method

The data for this assessment were collected from the inventory of 800 sample plots over Nepal, of which 650 plots were chosen with Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) greater than 0.4, 150 plots had an NDVI less than 0.4, and the rest 50 were non-bamboo plots selected by visual interpretation by systematic point sampling (every fifth). However, only the plots with NDVI greater than 0.4 were used for data analysis, as it was assumed that NDVI values below 0.4 were not represented by the annual green stand of bamboo and were confirmed later by field verification too.  The input points for visual interpretation have been generated from the entire area of interest using a 1 x 1 km grid in the entire country. Plots were chosen with the help of the connect earth online (CEO) app. Inventory was done through circular plots with a radius of 56.42m. The diameter at breast height (dbh), and the diameter above 30cm from the (ground) base (d30) was measured.
Height i.e., up to the point of culmination (vertical) was measured with the help of a vertex; total height was calculated with the help of the Pythagoras theorem. For that, the base distance was also calculated from the seedling point of bamboo in the field. A total of nine culms (three culms from each size class) were measured from each clump based on size class. The size class was defined as:

a.	Less than 4.5 cm as Small

b.	4.5cm to 7.5cm as Medium

c.	More than 7.5cm as Large

Rest was counted only according to age class, mainly defined as:

a.	Less than 1 year

b.	1-2 years

c. More then 3 years

Identification of age class and species was done on the basis of presence or absence of a sheath, the color of the culm, and with the help of local resource person (LRP).

Figure 2: Bamboo Height Measurement

Here in Figure 2, ‘H’ stands for the height culmination of the bamboo, i.e., the height from the ground to the point where the bamboo starts to lean. It was calculated with the help of a vertex. ‘b’ stands for the base distance from the seedling point of bamboo, and ‘tc’ stands for the height of bamboo, which was calculated by using the Pythagoras theorem as a square root of (square of tc + square of base(b)) as almost of the bamboos are leaning. Lastly, ‘l’ stands for the total length of the bamboo, which was measured after the felling of the bamboo.
Since the data used here was collected from destructive sampling, the bamboo culm to be felled was previously inventoried. d30, dbh, height up to culmination, and base were read orderly. Then the culm was finally felled. After felling, stump height, number of nodes, and diameter at different sections were measured. Also, the total length of the culm was measured up to the tip with the help of a linear tape. The data from 369 individual culms was taken for the study.


## Data collection

### Primary Data Collection

The main aim for this study was to assess and update bamboo resources information in Nepal in order to identify, map their distribution, collect samples, estimate volume, biomass, and growing stock of bamboo resources outside the forest area. Information on sample plots, methods adopted during sampling, and sample plot measurement were done according to the FRTC protocols, National Bamboo Resource Inventory Nepal (NBRAN) (proposed), and strictly following instructions from FRTC officials. Data were noted on the field tally sheets specially prepared for the Bamboo Resource Inventory by FRTC.


### Secondary Data Collection

Other secondary data were gathered through a comprehensive review of various manuals, published reports, and literature prepared by the FRTC, particularly about bamboo, and several other published reports and articles from different sources on the internet were taken into consideration during the whole data analysis.


## Data analysis

The analysis of the data involved the utilization of diverse software; QGIS, statistical packages in R software, Google Sheets, etc. No preliminary research findings were discovered on the topic during the literature review. Generally, for regression models’ different polynomial equations are used. For this paper, we have used simple linear regression models. Further data analysis instructions were as per guidance from experts in the FRTC.


### Data Validation and Arrangement

Data checking and validation were done by Google Sheets and different packages of R on close inspections of officers from FRTC and experts from the Genesis Consultancy.


### Defining the Independent Variable

The probable variables for these models are diameter at breast height (dbh), height of culmination, base, and the total length of bamboo obtained from destructive felling. The length in meter (m) was used as dependent variable, and the rest of the variables were independent.


### Correlation among the variables

The linear correlation between two continuous variables in a dataset is frequently determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Testing of correlation between the independent variable and each dependent variable was carried out, initiating model testing with a focus on a stronger correlation between the dependent and independent variables.
The formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient is given by:


$$[ r = \frac{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}}{{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}} ]..................                          (i)$$
### Fitting the models

Primarily, the height and diameter have a linear relationship, whereas some of the cases have the effect of other variables like climate, topography and other external factors.  In the case of bamboo and its nature of leaning and the portion of length after the culmination height, we collected data related to culmination height and base distance (distance between seeding point and the base of culmination height). So, we had three parameters to predict the total length of the bamboo culm.

Linear fitting was employed to establish the relationship model between height and diameter. Eighty percent of the dataset was designated as training data, while the remaining portion was allocated for assessing the developed model. This evaluation aimed to analyze the model's performance on hypothetical data and assess its applicability to fresh observations. The best fitting model has been given from the analysis, and the best fit of the model was tested by Adjusted R² and root mean square error (RMSE). Adjusted R² is a metric for gauging how well a model matches observable data. Demonstrating the model's capability to accommodate data variability, it quantifies the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that can be attributed to the independent variables. It takes into account how many predictors are included in the model and restricts the addition of extraneous predictors (Hocking, 1976). In regression tasks where the objective is to predict continuous numerical values, RMSE is particularly helpful in order to evaluate the accuracy of predictions and provide a significant measure of the model’s performance. It also has several appealing properties that make it a preferred option for assessing regression models (Willmott, 1981). For Adjusted R² higher values are preferred, ranging from 0 to 1, and that for RMSE, lower values are preferred. The formula for Adjusted R² is given by:
$$[\text{Adjusted R}^2 = 1 - \left(1 - R^2\right) \frac{n - 1}{n - k - 1}].............(ii)$$ 
Similarly, the formula for root mean square error is given by;

$$[ \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2} ]...........(iii)$$

### Preview of the data

Below is the table showing the necessary variables for the Bambusa species for analysis.

Below is the table showing the necessary variables for Dendrocalamus species for analysis. 

### Summary of Bambusa Group

The descriptive statistics for this study included mean, maximum and minimum values of dbh, height of culmination, base and length for Bambusa species, which are shown in the table below.


### Summary of Dendrocalamus Group

The descriptive statistics for this study included mean, maximum, and minimum values of dbh, height of culmination, base, and length for Dendrocalamus species, which are shown in the table below. 

### Correlation between the variables

Figure 3 explains that the length of the bamboo and the culmination height have the highest correlation, i.e., 0.9. As we know, there is a strong correlation between d30 and dbh, i.e., 0.96, so we used only the dbh as there will be higher multicollinearity between the given variables (i.e., there is no significant difference in using dbh and d30), and with the given multicollinearity, the model so formed tends to be complex, and thus the d30 was not used for further analysis. We started to test the model first with the dbh as independent variable and the length(m) as dependent variable. Similarly, the correlation between dbh and base was found to be 0.15, with the height of culmination being 0.68 and with the length to be 0.70. For better results, we kept on testing the model by adding one more variable, i.e., the height up to the culmination and the base. Following are the consecutive models prepared by adding one more variable, respectively.

## Discussion

### Testing the statistical differences in the results of two different models by applying the same independent variables to them

To test the statistical differences between the results of these two sets of predictions, we applied the same independent variables. The descriptive statistics employed in this study includes the average, maximum, and minimum values of diameter at breast height (dbh), height of culmination, and length.
The normality of the data was assessed through the Shapiro-Wilk test, which, in contrast to alternative tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov or Anderson-Darling tests, offers a more precise evaluation of normality, especially advantageous when dealing with small to moderate sample sizes, typically fewer than 2,000 observations (Shapiro & Wilk, 1965).
The formula for the Shapiro-Wilk test is given by;

$$[ W = \frac{{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i - \bar{x}\right)^2}}{{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}}].....................(iv)$$

In the box plot, the distribution of two sets of predictions has been shown. From the box plot, it has been proven that the data is almost normal with very few outliers.



### Result from normality test of two sets of prediction

From the test performed above for both, the predicted values, i.e., p values were 0.0203 and 0.0625, respectively. As the p-value was found to be less than 0.005 for the Bambusa group and greater than 0.05 for the Dendrocalamus group, they are considered statistically and marginally significant at a 0.95 confidence interval. This indicates that the test results are not likely to have happened by coincidence and there exists evidence which proved the data were almost normal. Since the data were almost normal, we calculated the variance of the data.

### Variance test

As the distribution of the prediction was not perfectly normal, we used classical Levene’s test to evaluate the equality of variances across various datasets. The test is frequently employed as a preliminary test, for some parametric tests such as the t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) (H, 1960). Some of the probable reasons that have led to marginally significant normality of the Dendrocalamus group could be

a. smaller sample size 

b. Few Outliers 

c. It might be because of moderate skewness or kurtosis.

The formula for Classical Levene’s test is given by:

$$( d_{ij} = |X_{ij} - \bar{X}_i| ) ..............(v)$$

The p-value derived from the variance test utilizing the classical Levene's test, which is based on absolute deviations from the mean, was determined to be 0.1, with a corresponding test statistic value of 2.71. As the result from the variance test was greater then 0.05, which is statistically insignificant, thus implying the results, we failed to reject the null hypothesis i.e., there is no any significant relationship between diameter and length of these two bamboo species. However, there are scholars who claim to have accepted alternative hypothesis based on higher correlation coefficients as significant relationships on their particular research (Wang et al., 2004). Here in this study, there was a strong correlation between dbh and length in m, i.e., 0.70, as the correlation coefficient itself is the measure of correlation strength (Lindley, 1999).

### T-test results

For testing the regression coefficients, we used a t-test. For t-test, we used Welch’s two-sample t-test which is applicable in situations where the presumption of equal variances might not apply, and is used to differentiate the means of two independent groups. It is a modified form of the two-sample t-test that takes into account the various variances present in the two groups being compared. When the assumption of equal variances is unclear, this test is more robust and dependable (Welch, 1947). The formula for Welch’s two-sample t-test is given by;

$$[ t = \frac{{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}}{{\sqrt{\frac{{s_1^2}}{{n_1}} + \frac{{s_2^2}}{{n_2}}}}} ]...............(vi) $$


The result from a welch two-sample t test was insignificant, as the p value was 0.7, i.e., greaterthan 0.05 and thus we could not conclude that the regression coefficients are statistically different from zero. This could mean the variable associated with these coefficients might not have a significant effect on the outcome being predicted by the regression model. Some of the probable reasons for non-significant regression coefficients could be:

a)	Multicollinearity (Collinearity arises in the context of data analysis when there is a high degree of correlation between two independent variables (Sarstedt & Mooi., 2019).)

b)	Smaller Sample Size

c)	They might have a weak effect on the model.

However, non-significant regression coefficients can still provide useful information in the model. Things that need to be considered for non-significant regression coefficient are:

a. Practical Significance      c. Theoretical Importance 

b. Model Selection              d. Multicollinearity

### Conclusion

The development of models for predicting the length of bamboo is very essential for the sustainable management of bamboo resources. Today, many planning and policy development processes cannot reach a logical conclusion without modeling and simulation. As a result, the objective of this study was to develop an individual model that will help us predict the length of standing bamboo culms to identify their growth for use in bamboo resource management found in non-forest areas or outside the forest. In this study, only a simple linear model was used to create the individual model for predicting the length of an individual culm. From the results, the simple linear model is the best fitting model for both groups, i.e., the Bambusa group and the Dendrocalamus group, with higher R² values. Thus, the final equation so obtained for the Bambusa group is:

The accuracy of this model is better because it uses individual culm-level variables and parameters. Moreover, this study offers a comprehensive model that predicts the length of bamboo using available variables, along with how accurate these predictions are. To conclude, the best results are obtained when all three of the variables are used as independents, i.e., the dbh, base, and height up to culmination.
